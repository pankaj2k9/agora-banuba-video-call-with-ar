# Build a Video Chat with React and Agora.io

## npm install
## npm start

Put a channle name liked test, in browser tab. Then press enter.

The  open another tab and http://localhost:3000 then put same input on there too and join.

So If i go first  tab now that would be local stream and  second tab would be remote stream.

Right Now we are not saving any where , so if I create 3rd tab then  It will not create 3 chat.

Becuase when I am realoding the page then reset to only one called local stream.
